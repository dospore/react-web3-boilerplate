# Dospore Web3 Boilerplate
Boilerplate that uses all the packages I like to work with.

## Vite
Not too attached to this one, anything with react is fine.

## Wagmi
For contract calls and interactions.

### Viem over ethers
I would prefer to use ethers here but wagmi primarily integrates with viem so we will go with that. Doesnt have as nice an integration with managing bigints though.

## Chakra
For styling and theming. Easiest extendable ui component library that I've worked with.

## Connectkit
As a an out of the box connection package. Nicely integrated with wagmi so I can drop it if I require a more custom build.

## Routing
React-router-dom for multi page setup. No major opinions on this one.
